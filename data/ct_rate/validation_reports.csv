No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and both main bronchi. Diffuse ground glass areas are observed in both lungs. The views described are nonspecific. However, appearances can be observed in viral pneumonia. It is recommended that the patient be evaluated from this point of view. No mass was detected in both lungs. Mediastinal structures cannot be evaluated optimally because contrast material is not given. As far as can be observed: Heart contour and size are normal.
