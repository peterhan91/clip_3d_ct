10032,115971233,PE452a52a,": 1. No pulmonary embolism, as queried. 2. Interval worsening in extensive ground glass opacity throughout the lungs, with a lower lobe preference, with associated reticulation and subpleural sparing. There are areas of nodular groundglass opacification as well. These findings are associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, small/trace bilateral pleural effusions, and a moderate pericardial effusion. Taken together, these findings are most compatible with an acute on chronic exacerbation of scleroderma related lung disease/nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Superimposed infection is difficult to exclude radiographically in this setting. 3. Prominence of the main pulmonary artery and reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins suggests pulmonary hypertension and resultant elevated right heart pressures. 4. Redemonstration of a mildly patulous esophagus, likely secondary to the underlying diagnosis of scleroderma, and predisposing the patient to aspiration.

Correlation with available prior imaging is recommended. In the absence of prior imaging, ultrasound is suggested if clinically indicated for further evaluation. 3. Mosaic attenuation in the lungs which can be seen in the setting of chronic small airway disease or as a sequela of resolved chronic PE."

This is nonspecific, with differential diagnosis including pericarditis, pericardial fat necrosis, or trace pericardial fluid. There are no substantial differences between the preliminary results and the impressions in this final report."
23152,125159624,PE4524967,No evidence of pulmonary embolism. No aortic dissection or pneumothorax. 2. No dense focal consolidation. 1.1 cm nodule versus scar in the posterior left lower lobe.

Motion artifact limits evaluation of distal pulmonary arteries. Large right and moderate left-sided pleural effusions, increased in size compared to the <DATE> PET. Circumferential soft tissue thickening of the distal esophagus, in keeping with known esophageal adenocarcinoma. Metastatic disease with pulmonary, muscular, and osseous involvement, and peritoneal carcinomatosis, characterized to better advantage on the <DATE> FDG PET-CT. There are no substantial differences between the preliminary results and the impressions in this final report."

No significant change in a right hilar mass and left axillary lymphadenopathy. New tree-in-bud nodularity in the right lower lobe associated with extensive endobronchial debris. Findings may represent infection, aspiration, or hemorrhage."
23197,128165054,PE452605a,No pulmonary embolism. No tortuous pulmonary vessels to suggest arteriovascular malformation.

AREA OF PLEURAL THICKENING WITH ADJACENT PULMONARY CONSOLIDATION IN THE SUPERIOR SEGMENT OF THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE. THIS IS NONSPECIFIC AND OF UNCERTAIN CHRONICITY. RECOMMEND COMPARISON WITH PRIOR IMAGING. THIS MAY REPRESENT SCAR WITH A SMALL FOCUS OF ROUNDED ATELECTASIS. HOWEVER, NEOPLASM CANNOT BE EXCLUDED BASED ON IMAGING FINDINGS ALONE.

Recommend comparison with prior outside studies for assessment of temporal stability, if available. If not available, per Fleischner Society guidelines for incidentally found soft tissue nodules measuring less than 6mm, no follow-up is necessary if patient is considered at low risk for lung cancer. If patient is considered to be at elevated risk for lung cancer, such as history of smoking, then low-dose CT follow-up in 12 months can be considered. There are no substantial differences between the preliminary results and the impressions in this final report."
